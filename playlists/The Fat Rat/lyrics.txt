Let's sing a song, full of hope, full of pain
Why don't you sing along my friend, for it's our last refrain?
Forever young, ever strong, ever brave
Memories like this never end, no, they don't fade away

#
So when I'm gone, oh, when I'm gone
I'll be right there, close to the sun (Close to the sun)
Keep holdin' on, keep holdin' on
And I'll be right there, close to the sun
Close to the sun

[Drop]
Close to the sun

#
Here's to the one, to let shine, through the rain
The ones who stood for something more, we won't forget your names
The tide is high, say goodbye or set it sail
And all those midnight secrets told, we'll take them to the graves

#
So when I'm gone, oh, when I'm gone
I'll be right there, close to the sun
Keep holdin' on, keep holdin' on
And I'll be right there, close to the sun
Close to the sun

So when I'm gone, oh, when I'm gone

And I'll be right there, close to the sun

Summer in the hills
Those hazy days, I do remember
We were running still
Had the whole world at our feet
Watching seasons change
Our roads were lined with adventure
Mountains in the way
Couldn’t keep us from the sea
Here we stand open arms
This is home where we are
Ever strong in the world that we made
I still hear you in the breeze
See your shadows in the trees
Holding on, memories never change
