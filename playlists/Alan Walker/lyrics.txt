You were the shadow to my light
Did you feel us?
Another star, you fade away
Afraid our aim is out of sight
Wanna see us alight
#
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Was it all in my fantasy?
Where are you now?
Were you only imaginary?
#
Where are you now?
Atlantis, under the sea, under the sea
Where are you now? Another dream
The monster's running wild inside of me
I'm faded, I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded, I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded
#
These shallow waters never met what I needed
I'm letting go, a deeper dive
Eternal silence of the sea
I'm breathing, alive

Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Under the bright but faded lights
You set my heart on fire
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
#
Where are you now?
Atlantis, under the sea, under the sea
Where are you now? Another dream
The monster's running wild inside of me
I'm faded, I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded, I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded

Lily was a little girl
Afraid of the big, wide world
She grew up within her castle walls
Now and then, she tried to run
And then on a night with the settin' sun
She went in the woods away
So afraid, all alone
#
They've warned her, don't go there
There's creatures who are hidin' in the dark
Then somethin' came creepin'
It told her, "Don't you worry, just
#
Follow everywhere I go
Top of all the mountains or valley low
Give you everything you've been dreamin' of
Just let me in, ooh
Everything you want in gold
I'll be the magic story you've been told
And you'll be safe under my control
Just let me in, ooh"

Just let me in, ooh

She knew she was hypnotized
And walking on cold, thin ice
Then it broke and she awoke again
#
Then she ran faster and
Start screamin', "Is there someone out there?
Please help me, come get me"
Behind her, she can hear it say
#
"Follow everywhere I go
Top of all the mountains or valley low
Give you everything you've been dreamin' of
Just let me in, ooh
Everything you want in gold
I'll be the magic story you've been told
And you'll be safe under my control
Just let me in, ooh"

"Everything you want in gold (Ooh)

Hello, hello, can you hear me as I scream your name?
Hello, hello, do you need me before I fade away?
#
Is this the place that I call home
To find what I've become?
Walk along the path unknown
We live, we love, we lie
Deep in the dark I don't need the light
There's a ghost inside me
It all belongs to the other side
We live, we love, we lie (We live, we love, we lie)
#
Hello, hello, nice to meet you, voice inside my head
Hello, hello, I believe you, how can I forget?
#
Is this the place that I call home
To find what I've become?
Walk along the path unknown
We live, we love, we lie
Deep in the dark, I don't need the light
There's a ghost inside me
It all belongs to the other side
We live, we love, we lie (We live, we love, we lie)
We live, we love, we lie|
