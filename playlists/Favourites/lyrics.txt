When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale

#
I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

#
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

#
At the curtain's call it's the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made

#
Don't wanna let you down, but I am hell-bound
Though this is all for you, don't wanna hide the truth
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

#
They say it's what you make, I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul, I need to let you go
Your eyes, they shine so bright, I wanna save that light
I can't escape this now, unless you show me how

#
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

Every time​ that I look in the mirror
All these lines on my face getting clearer
The past is gone
It went by like dusk to dawn
Isn't that the way?
Everybody's got their dues in life to pay, yeah

#
I know nobody knows
Where it comes and where it goes
I know it's everybody's sin
You got to lose to know how to win

#
Half my life's in books' written pages
Lived and learned from fools and from sages
You know it's true
All the feelings come back to you

#
Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away


#
Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away

#
Dream on, dream on, dream on
Dream until your dreams come true
Dream on, dream on, dream on
Dream until your dreams come true
Dream on, dream on
Dream on, dream on
Dream on, dream on
Dream on, ah!

#
Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away
Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away

Open up the champagne, pop!
It's my house, come on, turn it up

#
Hear a knock on the door and the night begins
'Cause we done this before, so you come on in
Make yourself at my home, tell me where you been
Pour yourself something cold, baby, cheers to this

#
Sometimes you gotta stay in
And you know where I live
Yeah, you know what we is
Sometimes you gotta stay in, in

#
Welcome to my house
Baby, take control now
We can't even slow down
We don't have to go out
Welcome to my house
Play that music too loud
Show me what you do now
We don't have to go out
[Post-Chorus]
Welcome to my house
Welcome to my house

#
Morning comes and you know that you wanna stay
Close the blinds, let's pretend that the time has changed
Keep our clothes on the floor, open up champagne
Let's continue tonight, come on, celebrate (That's how we do)

#
Sometimes you gotta stay in
And you know where I live (You know where I live)
Yeah, you know what we is (You know what we is)
Sometimes you gotta stay in, in (In, in)

#
Welcome to my house
Baby, take control now (Now)
We can't even slow down
We don't have to go out (Out, out)
Welcome to my house
Play that music too loud (Turn it up, turn it up)
Show me what you do now (Show me now)
We don't have to go out (Go out, go out, uh)
[Post-Chorus]
Welcome to my house (It's my house, come on, bring a friend)
Welcome to my house

#
Welcome to my duck-off, the crib, the spot, the pad
But my house is your house if you throwin' it back
Excuse me if my home's draining the sad
Soon as these happy faces land you can run with the cash
Homerun, slam dunk, touchdown pass
Mi casa es tu casa, so it ain't no holding back
Another shot of vodka, you know what's in my glass
It's my house, just relax

#
Welcome to my house
Baby (Hey), take control now (Woo, woo)
We can't even slow down (Hit the brakes, hit the brakes, go out)
We don't have to go out (Cheers to this)
Welcome to my house
Play that music too loud (Turn it up)
Show me what you do now
We don't have to go out (Go out)

|
(Ayy, ayy) Welcome to my house
(Ayy, ayy) Welcome to my house (It's my house, my house)
(Ayy, ayy) Welcome to my house (What?)
[Outro]
It's my house
